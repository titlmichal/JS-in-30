    // REFERENCE VS COPY ... kinda important to understand the difference

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100 --> bcs age was changed, but age2 was already assigneeeeee
    // works the same for strings and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Lux";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
        // we updated team
        // but team is a reference to the original players array
        // --> by updating the reference, the original was updated

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();  // slice w/o arg --> selects all items
    team2[3] = "Brody";
    console.log(players, team2);    // players are the same, team2 changes

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);   // take empty array and concat original one
    team3[3] = "Dom";
    console.log(players, team3);    // works as expected above

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // spreading as before --> spread each item of iterable to it
    team4[3] = "ET";
    console.log(players, team4);

    // or even .from method
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = "Yeti";
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person.number, captain.number);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // start with empty object: Object.assign({})
    // add what to copy: Object.assign({}, person)
    // and what to change: Object.assign({}, person, {number: 43})
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 199});
    
    console.log(person.number, captain2.number);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
